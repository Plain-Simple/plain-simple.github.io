It's been a difficult few weeks with lots of homework and college applications. We haven't been able to get as much as we wanted
to done. Nevertheless we've made a lot of progress porting the Spaceships game to Android, using an Android for Dummies book as
a reference. This is our first Android project so we're doing a lot of learning! We've also reached out to graphics and sound
artists and now have a loop for the title screen.  

At this point there isn't that much porting left to do. However due to the huge amount of school work we have it may take a while
to get Spaceships up and running on Android.  

In other news Matt used Announcer to host a successful Rubik's Cube contest. v2.0 is high on our list of priorities and we're 
considering a version with GUI.  

Also on our list of things to do is a major overhaul of our website. At this point it's a little bit of a mess and we'd like
to greatly simplify it. This will make maintenance much easier in the long run.
