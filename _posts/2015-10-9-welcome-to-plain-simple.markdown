Welcome to Plain Simple Apps!  

We are currently working on an array of projects:  
- The Plain Simple website: We're chipping away at this and hope to have it ready by November 1st. Things left to do include some small CSS stuff, getting some releases up, and working on the Support Us page.  
- Coding Reference Docs: We're working on writing documentation for various programming/coding topics. This is a more long-term project. Current docs we are working on include a Java reference, a C++ reference, and a Git reference. We may also write a regex and HTML/CSS reference.  
- Coding and Contribution Guidelines: We're finalizing Java coding guidelines and will get to work on contribution guidelines very soon.  
- Announcer: Matt is working toward another release which will include some better coding practices as well as one or two new features.  
- TextFormat: The former CLI-Util library has been renamed to TextFormat and can format Strings to variable column widths, left- right- and center-justified. We will be working on adding more functions and hope to have a v1.0 release within the next two weeks.  
- PracticeLog: A test release was made today. There are some bugs and features that will be added, such as more statistics and better Goals. We may also implement nicer styling and port to Android. This however is currently not a priority.  
- Spaceships: We will begin porting to Android soon. We will also be coding better Alien AI and better map generation (specifically better coin trails). Once we've ported to Android we will focus on the look of the game (specifically sprites) and more features (powerups, etc.).
- TextFile: In the near future we will create documentation and put the release up on the site. We have plans for v2.0.  
- Geometry Toolkit: We are looking at this with renewed interest. Once we have some of the higher-priority programs off our plate we will dive into this again.  
- Grapher: We're looking to do some rewriting for simpler algorithms as well as adding some small features before the 1.0 release.  

The next few months are going to see a lot of projects reaching maturity.
