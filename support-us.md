We are proponents of making software as widely accessible and as hassle-free as possible. For this reason we publish our code under an open source license, make our apps freely available, and avoid advertisements and in-app purchasing. We will never violate your privacy or take your information without consent.

We write and publish software because we like doing so - making money is not a priority. We try to make it as easy as possible to support us without spending money. If you are interested, see below for how you can help.
